<h2>PLAYING STYLE</h2>
<p>
  Ronaldo is able to play on both wings and also as a striker since he is very strong with both feet, even though he is naturally right footed.[77] He is also one of the world's fastest players.[78][79] He has good heading ability because he is over 6 feet tall and jumps high. He is also known for his powerful "knuckleball" free kicks. The "knuckleball" technique is when the ball spins very little and creates an unpredictable motion. He combines this with his powerful shot, making it hard for goalkeepers to stop his shots.<br> Ronaldo has also been known for his dribbling, as he likes to do many tricks and feints with the ball to pass defenders, such as the step-over.[80] When he was at Manchester United, he would play as a winger and try to send crosses into the middle. At Real Madrid, he changed his playing style by moving more towards the middle and becoming more of a striker.<br><br> He also focused more on scoring goals.[81] When he arrived to Juventus, he stayed with this playing style of being a goal scorer and target man, although he dribbled with the ball more because he sometimes liked to play his traditional winger position and go one-on-one with defenders. He also sent crosses more frequently than he did in his last few seasons at Real Madrid.<img src="https://www.deccanherald.com/sites/dh/files/styles/article_detail/public/article_images/2016/03/06/532901.gif?itok=6tx_zMYO"class="center" >
